    <p>
      Iâ€™m a web developer from Salvador, Brazil. I had my first contact with
      programming when I was 8, but only really got into coding when I was 10.
      Nowadays, I'm a fast learner and proficient in TypeScript and JavaScript,
      focusing on backend development.
    </p>
    <p>
      I've always been passionate about creating original and creative personal
      projects, which led me to develop several skills over the years. Also, I
      have always enjoyed participating in communities and projects with other
      people.
    </p>

    <p>
      I am interested in highly scalable technologies, DevOps, InfoSec, and
      entrepreneurship.
