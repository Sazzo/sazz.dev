  <p>
    Iâ€™m a web developer from Salvador, Brazil. I had my first contact with
    programming when I was 8, but only really got into coding when I was 10.
    Nowadays, I'm a fast learner and proficient in TypeScript and JavaScript,
    focusing on backend development.
  </p>
  <p>
    I've always been passionate about creating original and creative personal
    projects, which led me to develop several skills over the years. Also, I
    have always enjoyed participating in communities and projects with other
    people.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am interested in highly scalable technologies, DevOps, InfoSec, and
    entrepreneurship.
